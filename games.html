                Horizon Forbidden West proves the open world genre doesn’t have to be as creatively bankrupt as it currently is, even while sticking close to the genre’s conventions. With the right focus, the right setting, and the right storytelling, a game can remain in thrall to a familiar format and still feel inspired. It isn’t a game that will 
                surprise you or make you rethink the possibilities of what games can do, but it’s proof 
                that games can still be really fun even if they don’t try anything new, and that’s 
                something we don’t often see from big budget corporate games like this one.

            <h1> Hitman 3</h1>

                Playing Hitman 3 feels like being thrown into a random improv scene. 
                You’re constantly switching parts, objectives, and wardrobe, 
                making sure never to break character before you eliminate your target. 
                Every stage is a performance, and they’re all incredibly distinct 
                and fun. You play as world-class executioner, 
                Agent 47, and due to his occupation there’s a thick 
                cloud of intensity and death that follows him around every corner. 
                Each contract sends you to varied and visually striking locations 
                all over the globe, setting up flexible environment-specific 
                boundaries while simultaneously encouraging you to push against them 
                (or even throw it all out and do it your way). Both the plot and 
                general premise of IO Interactive’s Hitman 3 are straight-faced and sober, 
                yet it somehow manages to be one of the funniest games I’ve played 
                in a minute due to clever prop comedy and witty, well-written NPCs. 
                After spending a bunch of time playing around in its charming and compact 
                world, Hitman 3 has proven to be a well-constructed assassination sandbox 
                full of tension, fashion, and possibility.

            <h1>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</h1>

                Fallen Order stacks some of the best parts of Metroid, Dark Souls and 
                Uncharted inside a Star Wars trenchcoat, but that isn’t the smartest thing it does. 
                That would be how it squarely centers on the stress and trauma of its characters. 
                PTSD should be rampant in this universe, considering war is all anybody seems to know, 
                and yet within the Star Wars canon it’s rarely been focused on as keenly or depicted as 
                clearly as it is here. Its lead characters aren’t all that likable, for reasons that 
                are both intentional and unintentional, and that is a flaw; still, they feel a bit 
                more human than what you normally see in games and Star Wars stories, and that, 
                combined with the guaranteed to please 
                gameplay formula, makes Fallen Order a Star Wars highlight.
